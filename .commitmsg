v1.4.0: Autonomous scheduled tasks, outcome logging, tools admin

Major release adding four key improvements to the scheduled tasks system:

1. Autonomous cron via Agent_Controller
   - Tasks with a 'prompt' field route through LLM (run_autonomous_task)
   - Agent runs with full tool access in AUTONOMOUS MODE
   - Graceful fallback to direct callback if LLM not configured

2. Generic outcome logging wrapper
   - Every task execution wrapped with scheduled_task_start/complete/error
   - Includes duration timing, execution mode, result summaries
   - Errors captured with file/line info for debugging

3. Schedule management core tool
   - New manage_schedules tool available to all agents
   - Operations: list (all schedules), pause (unschedule), resume (reschedule)
   - Enables agents to discover and manage schedules via chat

4. Agent Tools admin page
   - New admin page showing all tools across all agents
   - Core vs Agent type badges, parameters, used-by columns
   - Filter by type (All/Core/Agent)

Other changes:
- Audit log: timestamps, expandable details, dynamic filters, 30-day retention
- Agent responses logged in chat_complete audit entries
- Security Monitor: first agent with autonomous daily scan prompt
- Scheduled Tasks page: Mode column (AI/Direct), improved info box
- Version bumped to 1.4.0
